# Ethereum Distributed Token Exchange

This repository is part of the [_Ethereum Developer Masterclass: ICO and Token Exchange with Solidity_](https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-masterclass/?couponCode=VOMTOMWEBSITE10) course on Udemy. The Token-Exchange can be tested with MetaMask and the Rinkeby Test-Net under [https://tomw1808.github.io/distributed_exchange_truffle_class_3/index.html](https://tomw1808.github.io/distributed_exchange_truffle_class_3/index.html)

The Exchange Smart-Contract has 3 functions:
1. Funding: It's possible to deposit and withdraw both _tokens_ of any kind and Ether
2. Trading: You can trade any kind of token against ether. Both market orders and limit orders. It's also possible to cancel an order.
3. Manangement: It's possible to add new tokens on the fly.

The Exchange is unit tested with Truffle's Test-Framework.

All of this is also shown in the Course!
